  <div className='about'>
  <p>Im an experienced Front end developer, making use of the ever expanding techologies within this field: HTML5, CSS, SASS, Grunt, JQuery etc.</p>

<p>A firm advocate of mobile first RWD. This basically means focusing on the content and how best to deliver it from its smallest viewable area, which tends to be mobile, and expand and adjust that up to desktop (or more). The UI side of me also looks at the differences in how devices will be used, and create the best experience for that aswell. Im looking at you, touch screen devices!</p>

<p>I work using Drupal, WordPress, Bootstrap, or even plain old Boilerplate.</p>

<p>I enjoy developing mobile first and the challenges presented in responsive web design and animations using CSS3. I love a nice subtle animation.</p>
